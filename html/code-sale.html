<p>  For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And along the way, lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you.    <a href="/">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a>. History does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme.   <em>Mark Twain</em>.
</p><p>Any man who can drive safely while kissing a pretty girl is simply not giving the kiss the attention it deserves.

   	        When I am abroad, I always make it a rule never to criticize or attack the government of my own country. I make up for lost time when I come home.
  <strong>Winston Churchill.</strong></p><p>    A hundredth of a second here, a hundredth of a second there - even if you put them end to end, they still only add up to one, two, perhaps three seconds, snatched from eternity.    <a href="#">Robert Doisneau.</a>    All I know is what the words know, and dead things, and that makes a handsome little sum, with a beginning and a middle and an end, as in the well-built phrase and the long sonata of the dead.   <strong>Samuel Beckett.</strong></p><p>    And this, our life, exempt from public haunt, finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, sermons in stones, and good in everything.    <a href="#">        <strong>William Shakespeare.</strong>    </a>
